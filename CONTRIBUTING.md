# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome pull requests
and issues.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch from `dev`.
2. Make your changes on that branch; no direct commits to `main` nor `dev`.
3. Commit in small, logical units. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification, e.g. `feat(api): add study lookup endpoint`.
4. Open a pull request against `dev` and fill in the PR template.

### Branch naming

Use short, descriptive names like `feat/add-stow-endpoint` or `fix/docs-typo`. Prefix with your username if working from a shared fork (e.g. `alice/feat/add-stow-endpoint`).

### Commit messages

We follow the Conventional Commits standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

Types include `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, etc. The body is optional but encouraged for context.

## Development Tips

* Run linters and tests before submitting your PR.
